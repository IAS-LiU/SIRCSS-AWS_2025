# SIRCSS Advanced Winter School in Computational Social Science 2025

## Introduction

All materials for the Winter School 2025 will be hosted in this GitHub Repo. This includes the schedule as well as any code you may need.

## Navigation on Campus

Since we are in the midst of a busy semester at the university, we will be switching rooms. The university provides a comprehensive interactive map to navigate around. [Link to MazeMap](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&config=liu&zlevel=2&center=16.176638,58.589049&zoom=16.2&campusid=754). 

## Schedule

For the full schedule in PDF format, please [see the accompanying PDF-file in this repository](./SIRCSS%20AWS%202025%20Schedule%20v1.pdf). Below follows an overview over the schedule.

### Course Description

The Advanced Winter School (AWS) in Computational Social Science at the Swedish Interdisciplinary Research School in Computational Social Science (SIRCSS) is a two-week intensive course designed to familiarize the participants with advanced methods in machine learning and network science for usage in CSS settings.

The first week is primarily dedicated to various state-of-the-art machine learning methods from supervised and parametric learning methods to the analysis of image data. In a mixture of lectures and laboratories, the participants will learn about one group of methods each day and then proceed to apply these methods directly.

In a second part, the participants will learn about advanced network science methods and apply the learned knowledge from the morning lectures in afternoon laboratories. Both the machine learning and network analysis parts are rounded off with one deep-dive seminar each.

The second week then shifts gears, with the participants finishing the network science part of the AWS, before moving on to group projects on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday and Friday are reserved for final project presentations.
